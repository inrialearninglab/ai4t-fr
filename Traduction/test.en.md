## A walk in Artificial Intelligence


### Intro (text)
Each of us, in our daily lives, has seen that many websites are able to recommend a film or product based on what you have previously seen and liked. Some are also able to tell which film you can go and see with your family, and which one with a group of friends.
Why not use ~~them~~ *(such possibilities)* to personalise learning paths by suggesting educational resources to the teacher for a student or a group of students?

Another example. On our smartphones, some applications *(like activity trackers)* allow us to record our movements, measure the number of steps we take every day, visualise and analyse the energy we have consumed, the performance we have achieved or the diet we should follow.

Wouldn't activity tracking also be useful in teaching, to better identify, understand and support the learner?

Thus, if many tools in very diverse fields allow feedback, synthesis, predictions and even recommendations and visualisations of all the analyses carried out, why not take advantage of these technological advances in artificial intelligence in the field of education?

This is what we are going to explore in these three introductory videos on artificial intelligence and in particular _learning analytics_, which is a major application of AI in education. *(It)* ~~and~~ is commonly defined as the observation, analysis and visualization of the learner's digital behaviours in their online learning activity.



### Video 1 - Training in Education

If we voluntarily adopt a somewhat caricatured ~~vision~~ *(view)*, we can say that school, in the broadest sense, offers training courses that can be represented as well-defined corridors, with an entry point, which is the one through which we enter the education system, and a more or less distant objective, which is the one of our exit, in the long term, to the professional world.

These corridors are relatively well mapped out, clear and well defined. And they are designed for students who are ready to follow them.
They are well aligned, well seated in the starting blocks and ready to start working efficiently.

Of course, we are all aware, and the actors in the education systems in particular, that for some pupils, this corridor is an obstacle course with sometimes significant difficulties.
Some will drop out. Others, fortunately, will succeed.

But the reality is much more complex than that.

When we look at the starting line, we see students who are indeed well prepared, ready to go.
There are others who, although they are ready to go, are not well equipped: they do not have the right tools, they do not have the right concepts. They don't have the right preparation, nor the right environment that will allow them to succeed.

Others are there, ready to participate, but don't fully understand what is expected of them and are then faced with difficulties.

And then there are those who, from the start, or quickly, give up. Or are not really ready to start.

Of course, each student will build his or her own learning path, and all paths are good. Whether they go through the sand dunes or stay in the well-marked corridors, whether they take other paths or whether they take a few breaks to regain their strength and recover.

Depending on the preference of each individual, these paths can be followed alone or with the support of other students or guides *(attendants)*.


**So where and how can artificial intelligence be used to ensure that ~~each~~ student can follow the learning path that is best suited to them?**

Can't we do as the ~~travel recording applications~~ *(activity trackers)* do to provide better analysis, through artificial intelligence, of digital learning behaviours and move towards greater personalisation.


### Video 2 - Observing student learning to guide them to success

Many digital traces are left by learners when they use digital tools.

First of all, there are all the traces that we leave naturally, without doing anything. For example, by accessing a service, a server, we leave a trace of our connection to that service. There are also all the traces left voluntarily, by writing, leaving comments or rating ~~with stars~~, for example. There is also the data associated with performance or results in a digital learning environment.
All this generates a body of information that can be analysed by artificial intelligence technologies.

**The question we can then ask ourselves is: How is it possible to analyse this set of information to help students in their learning and teachers in their pedagogy?**

If we draw a parallel with sports training, we can model information on activity times, the number of hours of sleep or recovery. Other traces are much more precise and can capture so-called biological signals, even emotions. In the context of sport, the traces make it possible, for example, to adjust the means of training or to provide better shoes.

**Can we not imagine, thanks to artificial intelligence, similar tools in the educational context?**

We can provide the student with tools that will allow ~~him~~ *(them)* to estimate where ~~he is~~*(they are)*  in relation to the behaviour ~~he~~ *(they)* should have, in relation to the mistakes ~~he~~ *(they)*  may have made, but also in relation to all the successes ~~he~~ *(they)* ~~may~~ have had. It is also possible to provide ~~him~~ *(them)*  with a certain amount of additional information, using predictive models.

We can offer ~~him~~ *(them)* additional personalised resources that will enable ~~him~~ *(them)* to better succeed on ~~his~~ *(their)* learning path.

**And from the teachers' point of view, how can the available observations help ~~him/her~~ *(them)* to adapt ~~his/her~~ *(their)*  teaching and pedagogy?**

With a tool such as a dashboard, the visualisation and analysis of digital behaviours can allow teachers to better understand what is happening to a student or a group of students at a given moment or over time and, eventually, to offer recommendations, suggestions using decision support tools.
These recommendations can be associated with explanations to enable teachers to decide whether or not to exploit them.

**And finally, can all these observations also enable the institution to organise itself better, to renew itself, and to no longer have these corridors so well traced, but more undulating, a little more tormented, and even, above all, much more individualised paths?**


### Video 3 - Learning Analytics

Teachers are encouraged to use new technologies. Pupils too, of course. And a whole digital ecosystem is developing around the teacher and the pupil.

The use of digital technology is materialised by access devices that are increasingly present: tablets, computers and, of course, wifi access. This digital environment provides access to information, learning environments, digital workspaces, electronic textbooks, transcripts, the digital school report and many other information and tools.
In addition to all this, there is also online educational content: textbooks or possibly free content such as open educational resources.

Of course, all these materials and resources do not replace the richness of the interaction between teacher and learner.

First of all, a number of things happen on the other side of a platform, of a screen, and we only see the result.
Secondly, teachers are used to picking up a certain number of clues in a classroom but are not trained, not used to perceiving them in the same way when they go through digital tools.

The clues that teachers are led to perceive in a real situation in a classroom are notably those of commitment *(engagement)* and motivation.
For example, you can see if a student is asleep. When the noise level rises you can tell that something is happening. When all heads are down during an explanation of a concept on the blackboard, you can tell that something unnatural is going on.
Even though there are many, many possible explanations, being able to pick up on these clues or lack of them is important.
When the pupil is no longer in front of the teacher, how can you see that he or she is dropping out, that he or she is no longer able to follow, either because it is too complicated or not adapted to the form of learning that suits him or her, or simply because he or she does not understand why he or she has to follow this teaching.

It is particularly in these areas, such as engagement or motivation, that the exploitation of digital traces by AI technologies can help the teacher, as well as the student.

More generally, according to Gartner's model, AI technologies, from the most basic to the most advanced, can help the teacher to describe (what happened?), diagnose (why did it happen?), predict (what will happen?) or prescribe (how to act according to the possible evolution?) a learning situation in order to better adapt it to a pupil or a group of pupils.



### Conclusion (text)
Thus, artificial intelligence is already present in our lives and can help personalise learning as well as meet other teachers' expectations by offering learning assistance, support or facilitation tools. There are, for example, tools to help with language learning or to facilitate the correction of papers.

But in fact, what is AI?
